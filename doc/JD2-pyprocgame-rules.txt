== Chain Features ==
There are 9 chain features, corresponding to the 9 inserts in the center of
the playfield. Each feature represents a mode. The left and right Fire buttons
change the next mode, as do the slingshots. The upper right 'build chain
feature' shot is active when not already in a mode or in multiball.
Shooting that shot starts the next mode. A video intro provides directions
before the ball is put back into play. The video can be cancelled with
the flipper buttons.

Every time a mode is completed successfully, a 10-second hurryup countdown
begins, and the D drop target is lowered to expose the subway shot.
Shooting into the subway before the timer expires awards a block
(explained below) or 10,000 points if all blocks are secured.
If multiball was active, it awards an additional 100,000 points.

The modes are timed. Hitting the Mystery target when lit while in a mode
extends the mode timer by 10 seconds. Hitting the Mystery target when lit
during the hurry-up countdown extends the hurry-up timer.

The number of shots required to complete a chain feature is determined by
a user configurable setting.

Each attempted feature contributes 4,000 points to the bonus. Each feature
completed successfully contributes 12,000 to the bonus. This bonus contribution
is not reset between balls.

==== Pursuit ====
Left and right ramps are lit with Pursuit flashers flashing.

==== Blackout ====
GI turns off. Left center ramp is lit with Blackout flasher flashing.
For the last required shot, the left center ramp re-lights for a double award
(2x Blackout flasher also flashes). The double award is required for mode
completion.

==== Sniper ====
Shoot the upper right VUK repeatedly to locate and kill the 'bad guy' sniper.

==== Battle Tank ====
Shoot the 3 battle tank shots: left outer loop, center target bank,
left center ramp.

==== Bad Impersonator ====
Rotating JUDGE targets

==== Meltdown ====
Shoot the captured balls. Each switch counts as a hit.

==== Safecracker ====
Shoot the subway.

==== Manhunt Millions ====
Shoot the left ramp.

==== Stakeout ====
Shoot the right ramp.

== Blocks ==
There are up to 16 city blocks to secure. The actual number of blocks
depends on a user configurable setting but is always a multiple of 4.
For each block, one or more of the crime scene inserts scattered around the
playfield is lit. Higher blocks require more shots to complete. Shooting the
3 target bank in the center of the playfield 3 times awards one shot.
Each shot to an active crime scene target awards 1,000 points, and each time
a block is a completed 10,000 points are awarded. An extra ball is lit after
completing 4 blocks. Completing all required blocks is needed before
Ultimate Challenge can be lit.

Difficulty settings determine how many and which crime scene targets are set
for each block.

The blocks are tracked in groups of 4. The 4 crime scene inserts
in the front-center of the playfield indicate which group is active.

The block number restarts at 1 after Ultimate Challenge.
Each completed block contributes 2,000 points to the bonus.
This bonus contribution is not reset between balls.

==== Block War Multiball ====
After every 4th block is completed, a 2-ball Block War multiball begins.
This progressive multiball mode starts with the crime scene insert lamps lit.
When all 5 crime scene shots are completed, a rotating jackpot shot is lit.
Collecting the jackpot awards 100,000 points and the mode starts again but
this time each shot must be hit twice. The third round requires 3 hits per shot,
and so on. The mode ends when a single ball remains.

== Deadworld Multiball ==
Locks are lit by completing all of the JUDGE drop targets. The first time
the targets are completed, all 3 locks are lit. After the first multiball,
completing all targets lights a single lock. When a lock is lit,
a shot to the left ramp is diverted into the Deadworld and locked.
3 lock shots are required to start this 3-ball multiball. The left ramp
lights the jackpot. The number of required left ramp shots always starts at 1
and increases by 1 for every jackpot collected. When the jackpot is lit,
shoot the subway to collect 100,000 points.

Deadworld Multiball can be started while a Chain Feature mode is active.
When that happens, both the Chain Feature mode and multiball continue
simultaneously.

== Missile Launch Award ==
Missile launch is fed via the center ramp. When missile launch is lit and
the ball is in the left shooter lane, the DMD scrolls through a set of award.
When the left shooter button is pressed, the active award is awarded.
Missile launch is lit when the ball enters the left shooter lane if
Deadworld Multiball is not active. When lit, the Air Raid lamp flashes
in front of the center ramp.

Awards include:
* Video mode
* Secure One Block
* Light Extra Ball
* 30,000 Points
* Increase Bonus Multiplier
* Hold Bonus Multiplier

Video mode is selected automatically unless a chain feature is active
in which case it is kept for the next missile launch.
Video mode can only be collected once per game.

If all blocks are secured, Secure One Block is replaced with 50,000 points.

After Light Extra Ball is collected, it is replaced with 20,000 points.
After Hold Bonus Multiplier is collected, it is replaced with 50,000 points.
Secure One Block, points and Increase Bonus Multiplier can be collected
more than once.

If Missile Launch is activated during a feature, the feature timer is paused
until the award is collected.

== Video Mode ==
Video Mode is activated from a Missile Launch Award, which can only happen
when a single ball is in play. When video mode is awarded, the ball stays
in the left shooter lane while the player plays through the mode on the
DMD using the flipper/fire buttons.

The mode is a shooting gallery. There are 12 targets.
(6 friends and 6 enemies)

Friends:
*Anderson
*Hershey
*Tweak
*Walter
*Johnny Alpha
*Vienna

Enemies:
*Pa Angel
*Mean Machine Angel
*Judge Cal
*Satanus
*Rico
*Child Mutant

At speeds that increase as the mode goes on, targets are randomly displayed
on the screen. The objective is to shoot enemies and not shoot friends.
The flipper buttons are used to move a scope target to the desired location,
and either fire button will shoot the targeted location. If a friend is shot,
the mode immediately ends in failure. The mode ends after a certain amount
of time. Reaching the end awards 5,000 times the number of enemies shot.
Shooting all 15 enemies awards 100,000 instead and lights an extra ball.
After Video Mode ends, the ball is automatically launched back into play.

== Miscellaneous Features ==
Consecutive shots to the right loop from the upper left flipper are counted
and awarded progressively higher points per shot. The player to achieve
the most consecutive shots is the 'Outer Loop Champion'.

Similarly, consecutive shots to the inner left loop from the upper right
flipper are counted and awarded progressively higher points per shot.
The player to achieve the most consecutive shots is the 'Inner Loop Champion'.

Full shots to the captive balls, resulting in the 3rd switch being hit,
light the Mystery shot and increase the Bonus multiplier by 1X.

For the skill shot, shoot the right loop from the upper flipper when
the ball starts. Continue loop shots to receive increasing point awards.

== Ultimate Challenge ==
Ultimate Challenge is a multi-stage wizard mode representing final battles
with each of the Dark Judges. Ultimate Challenge is lit when the following
requirements are met:
* All 9 Chain Feature modes attempted (completion not required)
* All required blocks are secured
* At least one Deadworld Multiball jackpot collected

Once Ultimate Challenge is lit, a shot to the upper right 'build chain feature'
shot initiates it. The player is presented with an Ultimate Challenge
introduction with instructions before Level 1 begins. Each time a level
is successfully completed, the machine goes dead, allowing all of the balls
to drain. Then the player is presented with instructions for the next
level before any balls are re-launched and put back into play.
If all balls drain before the player completes a level, the player's
ball ends and Ultimate Challenge is aborted. Re-lighting Ultimate Challenge
requires the player to complete the 3 major requirements again.
Subsequent Ultimate Challenge attempts begin at the first level not yet
completed by the player. In other words, previously completed levels
do not need to be completed again.

Successfully completing a dark judge mode awards 100,000 points.

=== Level 1: Fear ===
Fear uses timed shots to force the player to be accurate. This is a
single ball mode with a temporary ball saver. Each of the following shots
must be hit, in order, before a shot timer (20 seconds) expires:
Left Ramp, Right Ramp, Left Ramp, Right Ramp, D drop target, Subway.
Each shot resets the timer back to 20 seconds. If the timer expires
before a shot is hit, the game goes dead forcing the balls to drain
and ending the player's turn. 

=== Level 2: Mortis ===
This level is a 2-ball multiball with a temporary ball save. Each of the
following 5 shots must be hit twice in any order: Mystery, Left Loop,
Upper Right VUK, Right Ramp, and the 3rd Captive Ball. Each shot's insert
lamp blinks slowly to indicate 2 shots are required, blinks quickly to
indicate 1 shot is required, and is turned off when the shot is complete.


=== Level 3: Death ===
This level is a single ball mode with a temporary ball save. The player
has 3 minutes to clear all 5 shots. Every few seconds, a previously cleared
shot is relit. If the 3 minute timer expires, the game goes dead forcing
the balls to drain and ending the player's turn.

=== Level 4: Fire ===
All 5 crime scene shots are lit, representing fires that Judge Dredd needs
to extinguish. This level is a 4-ball multiball with no ball save.
Hitting mystery adds two balls. The mode is completed successfully
when the last fire is extinguished.

=== Final Level: Celebration ===
All dark judges have been defeated and banished. This level is a 6 ball
multiball with all shots awarding 10,000 points. This mode (and subsequently
the entire Ultimate Challenge) ends when there is only 1 ball remaining
in play. The game then begins anew.

== SuperGame ==
Pressing the SuperGame button starts a game in Ultimate Challenge.

Each ball starts at the first ultimate challenge level not yet completed by
the player. When Celebration ends, that player continues the rest of the game
like regular play.

== High Scores ==
The following high scores are tracked:
* 5 highest regular game scores
* 5 highest supergame scores
* Max inner loop combos (upper right flipper loops)
* Max outer loop combos (upper left flipper loops)
* Max number of blocks secured
